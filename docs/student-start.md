# Student guide: your pair case study

**Your semester in one sentence:** work with a partner to investigate an agentic
workflow in a real business use case, assess one risk, and evaluate a possible
improvement using evidence.
You will learn the basics together before taking on a small research task.

The VIP title is **Agentic AI for Risk Management**. The [shared research focus](research-plan.md#shared-theme)
is risk assessment and improvement of agentic business workflows. Choose one small
question about reliability, decision quality, oversight, permissions, security,
accountability or another relevant risk. Propagation is optional. The
[case guide](studies/README.md#examples-of-bounded-questions) shows examples and how
to keep the scope manageable.

Start with this guide. The [resource guide](literature.md) explains the basic terms
and reading. Detailed protocols and framework documentation are references for a
specific task, not required introductory reading.

The roadmap gives starting targets. The instructor can adapt the scope, timing
and activities through course announcements or discussion. Keep a brief dated note
in the affected issue; maintainers update shared guidance. You can start small
tasks with your partner and arrange peer feedback without waiting for instructor
approval or an assigned mentor. See [how adjustments work](semester-plan.md#adaptation-and-decision-making).

## What to do first

Kickoff was scheduled for **September 18, 2026**. By the **September 25 working
checkpoint**, each student should:

1. Open **New issue → Individual task**, parent **[#5](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/5)**. Add your roster row through
   a PR using the instructions below. No personal profile file is needed.
2. Open an Individual task under **[#1](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/1)**. Try the starter with help; record the command
   and result or exact setup error, plus one observation or question. Use the
   [guided trace walkthrough](starter-walkthrough.md), including its worked example
   while setup is blocked. The starter makes no paid model calls.
3. Share a business interest and any support need. Agree one achievable next task.
   Agree a partner and register the case when ready; ask for pairing help if needed.
   You do not need a partner to onboard.

Existing onboarding/starter work counts. Link it rather than redo it. Late joiners
agree a target after joining. Public reading, cloning, issues, and fork PRs need no
collaborator invitation; a maintainer can set issue fields. See [access](access-management.md).

## Your responsibilities

### Two issue types you create

| Create | Who owns it? | What goes there? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[Individual task](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/new?template=work-item.yml)** | You: one student per task. | Your next contribution, evidence, review and progress. |
| **[Pair case](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/new?template=pair-case.yml)** | You and your partner: one case issue for the semester. One partner creates it. | Your shared question, plan, links to both students' tasks, and shared output checklist. |

**Cohort** means the whole class. Existing **[Cohort]** issues explain common
assignments or collect progress across pairs; they are maintained for everyone.
Your pair's shared work lives in its **[Pair]** case. Keep presentation, analysis
and report checkpoints in that one case; record your own part in an Individual
task. Reuse a task when it already covers your contribution.

In a new task, **Primary parent issue** just means the related issue number:
enter `#5` for onboarding, `#1` for the starter, your Pair case number for research,
or `#23` for your individual report. Register your Pair case once in #3; link
your personal tasks in their parent (a comment is enough). You can open issues
in the main repository while making file changes in your fork.
If your partner created the Pair case and you cannot edit its checklist, add
your links or update in a comment; its author or a maintainer can update the body.

For example, a pair might study errors in a refund workflow. One partner owns
a sourced workflow-and-risk map; the other owns an initial example and its
evidence check. Each has a personal task, and both task links go in their shared
Pair case. They can later share a table or PR while explaining each person's
actual contribution. These are example tasks, not fixed semester roles.

### What each person and pair delivers

- **As a pair:** choose one case, keep one case document, present it around midterm,
  produce evidence and a final report, and give a final presentation.
- **Individually:** agree your own tasks, produce attributable work, review/support
  others, and write a short individual contribution report.
- **As a cohort:** share useful sources and tools and review another pair's work.

The [tentative grading proposal](grading-proposal.md) is **75% individual / 25% pair**:
individual work 55 (Foundation 10, Question 10, Execution 25, Synthesis 10),
collaboration 10, individual report 10; pair midterm presentation 10 and final
report/evidence 15. The final presentation has feedback but no separate weight.
The instructor confirms the policy; issues and commits are not points.

## Throughout the project

Each pair registers one **Pair case** issue through [#3](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/3).
Use the [short case outline](studies/README.md#short-proposal-outline), then grow the
same document into the report. A study plan specifies the question, evidence,
comparison, measures, and analysis. Record a dated working version, then refine
it as you learn. State evaluation rules before using them, label exploratory work,
and record changes made after inspecting evidence. Peer checks support the findings.

### Weekly goals

Weeks end on Fridays from kickoff. These are planning targets, not extra weekly
submissions or confirmed meeting times. Adjust them with course direction and
progress; agree a small scope suited to your experience.

| Week ending | Your individual goal | Pair or cohort outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sep 25 — learn the basics (M1)** | Roster PR; starter attempt or blocker; one trace observation/question. | Shared walkthrough and setup help ([#5](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/5), [#1](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/1)). |
| **Oct 2 — explore a business case** | Read a relevant source or inspect an example; explain one useful finding. | Agree partners, a workflow and possible risk; share useful examples or setup questions ([#6](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/6)). |
| **Oct 9 — outline the case (M2)** | Contribute a sourced question, workflow map, measure, or feasibility check. | Register the Pair case under [#3](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/3); complete its short outline and agree who does what. |
| **Oct 16 — present and refine (M3)** | Explain your part of the question, evidence plan, and feasibility result; act on feedback. | Pair midterm presentation ([#21](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/21)), dated working method and small validation ([#7](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/7)). |
| **Oct 23 — collect/check evidence** | Complete a small implementation, trace-labeling, validation, or analysis task. | Use the recorded method, check the evidence and seek peer feedback. Record findings and any changes; no instructor sign-off gate. |
| **Oct 30 — analyze (M4)** | Produce and check your evidence/analysis contribution, including failures. | Pair's first analysis, counts, relevant risk/utility tradeoffs, and limitations ([#8](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/8)). |
| **Nov 6 — draft** | Write your contribution to the pair report and your own individual report. | Pair draft ([#9](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/9)) and individual drafts ([#23](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/23)); identify evidence gaps. |
| **Nov 13 — review and repair** | Review agreed work from another pair or check a handoff; address feedback. | Reproduction/source checks and revised reports. Share reusable improvements. |
| **Nov 20 — explain and hand off (M5)** | Finalize evidence and your individual report; explain your contribution. | Pair report/evidence ([#9](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/9)), final presentation ([#22](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/22)), and individual reports ([#23](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/23)). |

If setup, data, or a partner dependency blocks you, post what happened and what help
you need in your task. Narrow the next task with your partner; seek guidance for
unresolved needs or changes to assessed expectations.
A date does not make an unfinished study complete. See the [canonical schedule](semester-plan.md#calendar-and-working-targets).

## Every week: work, share evidence, and get review

1. Agree one manageable next contribution with your partner and record it in your
   Individual task. Arrange a peer check as the work develops.
2. Work on it and link the source note, code, analysis, review, or other artifact.
3. Post a short update: **evidence produced; next step; blocker/help needed**.
4. Submit a PR when repository files change; respond to feedback. Close only your
   completed task. A pair case stays open until the pair's full work is reviewed.

**Before calling a task done:** link your output, explain what you did and found,
and link a peer's check of the agreed criteria. A partner can review; a checked
failed attempt or useful diagnosis can be a valid output. If review is pending,
say **ready for review** and keep the task open. If blocked, record the exact
problem and help needed. An issue comment can hold a short reading note or starter
record; it does not need a PR unless repository files change.

Say when you need help or your evidence is ready for review in that same task.
A maintainer can add `help wanted` or `needs-review`; you do not need label
permissions to request support. Keep shared output links in the Pair case's
checkpoint checklist. Register the case once in #3; the other cohort collections
refer to it, so you do not have to repost each output in several issues.

Multiple students may independently attempt the same agreed assignment with separate
tasks and evidence. Partners can also share an artifact, identifying each person's
actual part. There is no issue quota and no extra contribution log.

## Resources: what to read and where to save work

| Need | Read / save here |
| --- | --- |
| Basic concepts and a small reading path | [Resource guide](literature.md); one guided methods reading plus sources relevant to your case |
| Choose the case and write the evidence plan | [Case guide](studies/README.md); copy [template](studies/_case-template.md) to `docs/studies/pair-CASE-SLUG.md` |
| Optional examples / setup support | Share tested resources or help requests in [#6](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/6); choose accessible evidence for your case without waiting for an instructor-prepared package |
| Starter commands and code | [README](../README.md#run-the-pilot), `src/agentic_risk/`, `experiments/pilot.toml`, `tests/` |
| Understand the starter outputs | [Trace walkthrough](starter-walkthrough.md); record the observation in your existing starter task |
| Personal work and review | Your Individual task under your Pair case; common onboarding [#5](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/5), starter [#1](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/1), and individual report [#23](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/23) |
| Source notes | Your task or case document, linked to sources; shared reusable notes can go in [literature](literature.md) |
| Experiment/analysis provenance | [Experiment record](experiment-record.md), only applicable fields; link from the case document |
| Data, traces, figures | [Results policy](../results/README.md); use `results/local/` for local runs and pair-specific names for reviewed artifacts |
| Pair report and slides | Evolve your case document into the report; link it and slides from [reports index](reports/README.md) |
| Individual report | [Template](contributors/_individual-report-template.md) → `docs/contributors/YOUR-USERNAME.md`, draft Nov 6, final Nov 20 |
| Grading, access, and GitHub help | [Grading](grading-proposal.md), [issue guide](issue-workflow.md), [access](access-management.md), [contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) |

Do not read every advanced reference before starting. Agent Assurance is optional;
no one must implement all its controls or complete its institutional templates.

## 1. Clone and run

Install Git and Python 3.11 or later, then follow the [README run commands](../README.md#run-the-pilot). Choose the macOS/Linux or Windows PowerShell commands; they clone the repo, create a Python environment, install the package, run the pilot and check it. No model account or API key is needed for the starter.

The checks should report 10 passing tests. The default pilot produces 480 scripted trials and 12 summary rows. Use the [walkthrough](starter-walkthrough.md) to inspect `summary.csv` and a matched case from `trials.jsonl`. Local output stays on your computer; record a concise reproduction note when it becomes part of a task.

This runnable starter is a deterministic mechanism check that gives the cohort a shared setup and trace format. It does not choose your pair's question. [Candidate A](studies/01-runtime-containment.md) is a proposed runtime-containment study, not an implemented or preselected continuation of the starter.

## 2. Make your first visible contribution

On [the repository page](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk), click **Fork** to create a working copy in your GitHub account. The official repository remains the shared destination for everyone's work. Forking lets you contribute before being invited as a collaborator.

In the clone you already made, replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your own GitHub username:

```bash
git switch -c onboarding/YOUR-USERNAME
git remote add fork https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk.git
```

Add one row to [CONTRIBUTORS.md](../CONTRIBUTORS.md) with your preferred public
name and GitHub profile link, following the [enrollment guide](contributors/README.md#first-contribution).
Your username is enough as a display name. Your first PR only needs this roster
change; no personal profile file, report, or research result is required.

Before committing, set your Git author name and account-associated email in this repository. A GitHub `noreply` address keeps your email private; copy the exact value from your account's email settings. See [the attribution guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md#make-your-contributions-visible).

Replace the placeholders before running:

```bash
git config user.name "Your preferred public name"
git config user.email "YOUR-EXACT-GITHUB-NOREPLY-ADDRESS"
```

```bash
git add CONTRIBUTORS.md
git commit -m "Add my Fall 2026 roster entry"
git push -u fork onboarding/YOUR-USERNAME
```

If Git asks you to authenticate, use GitHub Desktop's sign-in or GitHub CLI's `gh auth login`. The [GitHub authentication guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github) covers the available methods.

## 3. Open a pull request

GitHub shows a **Compare & pull request** link after you push. Choose **base repository** `zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk`, **base** `main`, and your fork/branch as the source. Describe what you changed, name the current milestone (**M1** during kickoff), and link the [onboarding issue](https://github.com/zhongnz/Fall26VIP_Agentic_Risk/issues/5) with `Relates to #5`, plus `Closes #YOUR_TASK_NUMBER` for your own completed onboarding task (replace with its actual number). Do not close the whole cohort's onboarding issue for one person's enrollment. If you cannot edit GitHub's milestone or assignee fields, put the information in the PR description and a maintainer will set them.

A maintainer reviews the PR. If they request edits, make another commit on the same branch and push it; the PR updates automatically. CI for a first-time fork contributor may wait for a maintainer to approve running it. Once merged, your roster entry and original commit appear in the canonical repository.

For a documentation-only first contribution, you can also use GitHub's browser editor in your fork: edit the roster, then open a PR. GitHub Desktop is another option if you prefer a graphical Git interface.

## 4. Pick a small task and keep the evidence

After pair formation, use **New issue → Individual task** with your **Pair case issue**
as the primary parent. Select the **Assessment category**, then state your deliverable, target, peer reviewer when arranged,
and what evidence will show it is done. For common work, use the existing cohort goal
instead. See the [complete task map](issue-workflow.md#complete-task-and-assessment-map).
The category's weight is for that semester component, not for each issue. Existing
tasks that name their stage still count; use the form for new work.

Examples: explain a paper's implication for the case, design test cases, check labels,
implement a small control, analyze a trace set, or verify reproduction instructions.
You do not need to build an agent framework. Both partners should understand the
method and findings; rotate roles with guidance rather than dividing permanently
into a programmer and a writer.

Before a new branch, update a clean working tree:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git switch -c work/ISSUE-NUMBER-short-description
```

Replace the placeholder; push to your fork and open a PR to the official `main`.
Link evidence in your task and later in your individual report. No duplicate portfolio
or weekly slide deck is required. Keep marks and private feedback out of GitHub.
